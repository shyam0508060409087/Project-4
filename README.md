# 📘 Week 4 Java Mini Projects - README

Welcome to the **Week 4 Java Mini Projects Repository**! This week focused on solidifying core concepts in **Linked Lists**, revising **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and practicing with **Java Collections Framework**. Below are the three mini projects built and explained with usage and structure.

---

## 🔹 1. Linked List Manager (Reversing, Adding, Deleting Nodes)

### 📄 Description:

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **singly linked list** in Java, with methods to:

* Add elements to the beginning or end
* Delete from the beginning or end
* Reverse the list using iteration
* Print the list

### 🛠️ Concepts Used:

* Class & Object
* Pointers and Node chaining
* Iteration for reversal

### 🚀 How to Run:

```bash
javac LinkedListManager.java
java LinkedListManager
```

---

## 🔹 2. OOP-Based Student Management System

### 📄 Description:

A simple system to manage student records using the **OOP principles** like:

* Encapsulation
* Constructor initialization
* Object arrays

### 🛠️ Features:

* Create student objects
* Display student details using methods

### 🚀 How to Run:

```bash
javac StudentSystem.java
java StudentSystem
```

## 🔹 3. Collections Practice Toolkit - Word Frequency Counter

### 📄 Description:

Reads a string from user input and counts frequency of each word using Java **HashMap**.

### 🛠️ Concepts Used:

* HashMap
* String manipulation
* Scanner and loops

### 🚀 How to Run:

```bash
javac WordFrequencyCounter.java
java WordFrequencyCounter
```

### 📌 Sample Output:

```
Input: This is Java and Java is fun
Output:
This: 1
is: 2
Java: 2
and: 1
fun: 1
```
